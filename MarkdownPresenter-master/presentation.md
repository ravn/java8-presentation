Java 8
===

* Basics for all I could find of new stuff for Java 8.
* Some Java 7 too.


!

JVM stuff first...

![Zzzz!](/6a00d8341c858253ef00e54f60280d8834-640wi.jpg "horrified cat")



!

### invokedynamic

New byte code instruction added.

Allows user space code to help Hotspot to resolve
type information at runtime instead of compile time.

Is very helpful to "duck typing"-languages like JRuby.

Also used for creating the object representation for Î»-expressions.

<http://blog.headius.com/2008/09/first-taste-of-invokedynamic.html>

!

### Garbage Collection

Permgen is replaced with
Metaspace which use native memory instead of
a fixed size pool.

Can grow _much_ bigger!

* `-verbose:gc` - activate simple GC logging.
* `-XX:+PrintGCDetails` - activate detailed GC logging.
* `-Xloggc:<file>` - send GC log to _file_ instead of console.
* `-XX:+PrintGCDateStamps` - add date stamp to every line.
* `-XX:+PrintGCTimeStamps` - adds seconds since JVM start to every line.

!

Example:

!

### Garbage collectors

Default garbage collector is still Parallel (which can stop the world).

Concurrent-Mark-Sweep performs better due to background work but can still
stop the world.

Alternative G1 is for +4GB heaps which can do string deduplication. May be default
in Java 9.  Rarely stops the world.

Don't mess with it unless you know exactly what you are doing.  This includes
accepting JVM flags for previous versions of Java!

!

### New tools

Java Packager - "performs task related to packaging and signing Java/JavaFX
applications".  JavaFX is a new GPU-powered UI for Java,
and is not covered in this presentation.

jdeps - static dependencies of applications and libraries.

jjs - JVM-based JavaScript engine useful for scripting (more later)

Java Flight Recorder can collect low level data for Java Mission Control
to allow after-the-fact incident analysis. (Commercial, can be enabled at runtime).
Worth looking into.

Advanced Management Console can give an overview of Java applications
and their JRE's in an organization. Runs in WebLogic 12. (Very commercial)

!

javac
---

New option `-parameters` saves the names of constructor and method
parameters so they can be retrieved by reflection.  New checkbox in
Eclipse.

New option `-profile X` ensures that the source conforms to compact
profile X (a well defined subset of the JRE).

* "compact1" is for simple command line programs.
* "compact2" is "compact1" + RMI/JDBC/XML
* "compact3" is "compact2" + JMX/JNDI/security/annotations


<https://blogs.oracle.com/jtc/entry/a_first_look_at_compact>

!

Nashorn - JSR-223 Javascript engine
---

Newly written for Java 8 to utilize `invokedynamic`.

* is 2-3 times slower than the highly optimized V8 engine after warmup.
* can easily be used for scripts with `jjs -scripting` .
* has full access to the standard Java libraries including JavaFX.
* can be used for configuration scripts (code as opposed to stringly typed properties) 
with the JSR-223 classes.
* Can use many Node.js packages.
* Netbeans 8+ and IntelliJ 13+ can be used for debugging.

!

Nashorn scripting:
---


    #!/usr/bin/env jjs -scripting

    print(<<EOD);
    ...${arguments[0]}---
    EOD

Full access to JVM including JavaFX.  Sweet spot is single-class-sized
application possibly with a GUI.  Main developer side project is
"Nasven" to put Maven artifacts on the classpath.

Does not yet appear to have reached critical mass or found a killer-application.


!

## Miscellaneous.

* Endorsed dirs mechanism and extension mechanism are deprecated as of 8u40.

* Scheduled regular security updates with predictable numbers.

* JRE expires automatically when the next security update is released.

!

But what can we do in _our own code_?
---

![](/Cute-Kitten-kittens-16096139-1280-800.jpg "ready!")

!

I/O
---

New I/O classes replacing `java.io.File` with friends.  Not hard bound
to underlying operating system.  File system implementations can be added
(e.g. ZipFileSystem).

`java.nio.file.Path` - text-only representation of a location in a given file
system.  Bridge:  `File.toPath()`.

`java.nio.file.Paths` - operations on paths.

`java.nio.file.Files` - operations on file systems.


Note:  All output shown has been generated on  Linux.  Comments indicate what
would be printed if the expression was printed.

!

Path + Paths:
---

    Paths.get("/tmp/foo");
    Paths.get(args[0]);
    Paths.get(URI.create("file:///Users/joe/FileTest.java"));
    FileSystems.getDefault().getPath("/users/sally");

    Path p5 = Paths.get(System.getProperty("user.home"),
                        "logs", "foo.log");

    p5.toAbsolutePath() // "/home/tra/logs/foo.log"
    p5.toUri()          // "file:///home/tra/logs/foo.log"
    Paths.get("/proc", ".", "..", "tmp").normalize() // "/tmp"

    p5.toRealPath()
    // Exception ...NoSuchFileException: /home/tra/logs/foo.log


!

    Paths.get("/tmp").resolve("log")
    // /tmp/log

    Paths.get("/tmp/foo").relativize(Paths.get("/tmp/bar"))
    // ../bar

    Paths.get("/tmp/foo").equals(Paths.get("/tmp/foo"))
    // true

    Paths.get("/tmp/foo").endsWith("foo")
    // true
    Paths.get("/tmp/foo").endsWith("oo")
    // FALSE <- not string level.

!

`Files.exists(Path, LinkOption...)` and `Files.notExists(Path, LinkOption...)` can
be used to examine if a Path exists or not.  If both returns false, the existence
of the file cannot be verified.

`Files.isReadable(Path)`, `Files.isWritable(Path)`, and `Files.isExecutable(Path)`
examines the permissions at the time of execution.  Beware race conditions.

`Files.isSameFile(Path, Path)` compares two paths - respecting symbolic links - to
see if they locate the same file in the file system.

!

`Files.delete(Path)` throws an exception if the deletion fails (NoSuchFileException,
DirectoryNotEmptyException, IOException, SecurityException) which can
be examined to handle the problem.

`Files.deleteIfExists(Path)` does not throw an exception if the file did
not exist.

!

`Files.copy(Path, Path, CopyOption...)` provides a built-in copy method.
Target must not exist, unless `CopyOption.REPLACE_EXISTING` is provided.

Directories can be copied.  Files inside directories will not be copied.

When copying a symbolic link, the target of the link is copied.  To copy
the symbolic link itself provide `CopyOption.NOFOLLOW_LINKS` or
`CopyOption.REPLACE_EXISTING`.

`CopyOption.COPY_ATTRIBUTES` copies the file attributes too.  Notably
last-modified-time.

`Files.copy(...)` also accepts InputStream and OutputStream to
copy single byte streams.

!

`Files.move(Path, Path, CopyOption...)` moves a file or directory.
The move fails if the target file exists, unless `CopyOption.REPLACE_EXISTING`
is provided.  If the target is a symbolic link, the link is replaced but what it pointed to
is unaffected.

Empty directories can be moved.  If the directory is not empty, the move is allowed
when the directory can be moved without moving the contents of that directory.
(For Unix that would be possible within the same partition by renaming the directory)

`CopyOptions.ATOMIC_MOVE` performs the move as an atomic operation.  An
exception is thrown if this is not supported by the file system.  Doing this
guarantees that any process watching the directory accesses a complete file.

!

Metadata (yay!)
---

* `Files.size(Path)` - in bytes
* `Files.isDirectory(Path, LinkOption)`
* `Files.isRegularFile(Path, LinkOption...)`
* `Files.isSymbolicLink(Path)`
* `Files.isHidden(Path)`
* `Files.getLastModifiedTime(Path, LinkOption...)` and
`Files.setLastModifiedTime(Path, FileTime)`

!

More metadata!
---

* `Files.getOwner(Path, LinkOption...)` and `Files.setOwner(Path, UserPrincipal)`
* `Files.getPosixFilePermissions(Path, LinkOption...)` and `Files.setPosixFilePermissions(Path, Set<PosixFilePermission>)`
* `Files.getAttribute(Path, String, LinkOption...)` and `Files.setAttribute(Path, String, Object, LinkOption...)`
* `Files.readAttributes(Path, String, LinkOption...)` and `Files.readAttributes(Path, Class<A>, LinkOption...)`

* `Files.getFileStore(Path)` - get total space, unallocated space, and usable space (and more).


!

Reading/writing/creating
---

Many methods now take an optional `OpenOption` parameter.
The `StandardOpenOptions` enum provide:

* `WRITE` - open for write access.
* `APPEND` - append new data to end of file (WRITE, CREATE)
* `TRUNCATE_EXISTING` - truncates file to zero bytes (WRITE)
* `CREATE_NEW` - create new file, throw exception if already exists.
* `CREATE` - open file if it exists, create new otherwise.
* `DELETE_ON_CLOSE` - delete the file when the stream is closed. Good for temporary files.
* `SPARSE` - hint that new file will be sparse.  Supported by NTFS and possibly others.
* `SYNC` - keep the file (both content and metadata) synchronized with the underlying storage device.
* `DSYNC` - keep the file content synchronized with the underlying storage device.

!

Misc helpers:

    byte[] fileArray = Files.readAllBytes(Paths.get(...));
    Files.write(Paths.get(...), fileArray);
    Files.createFile(Path)
    Files.createTempFile(Path, String, String, FileAttribute<?>)


Helpers for as efficient I/O as possible:

    Files.newBufferedReader(Path, Charset, OpenOption...);
    Files.newBufferedWriter(Path, Charset, OpenOption...);
    Files.newInputStream(Path, OpenOption...);
    Files.newOutputStream(Path, OpenOption...);
    Files.newByteChannel(Path, OpenOption...)

!

    FileSystems.getDefault().getRootDirectories()
    Files.createDirectory(Path)
    Files.createTempDirectory(Path, String, FileAttribute<?>)
    Files.createSymbolicLink(Path, Path, FileAttribute<?>)
    Files.createLink(Path, Path) // hard link!
    Files.readSymbolicLink(Path) // resolve link



File names in a directory can be read one by one with
`Files.newDirectoryStream(Path, ...)`.  An optional glob filter
can be used.

!

Walking the file tree:
---

Implement `FileVisitor<Path>` or override `SimpleFileVisitor<Path>` and
use it with `Files.walkFileTree(Path, FileVisitor)`.  Can weld under
water.

For most uses `File.walk(Path)` may be sufficient.

![walk!](/a-cat-climbing-down-a-tree-81775.jpg "Cat walking a tree")

!

Watching a directory for changes:
---

* Create a `WatchService`
* For each directory, get a `WatchKey` by registering it and the events you want with the watch service
* Create infinite listening loop listening for events.
* When an event occurs, the key is signalled and put in the watch service queue.
* Retrieve the key from the watch service queue.  The file name is in the key.
* Process all pending events for the key as needed.
* Reset the key, and resume waiting for events.
* Close the service.

<https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/notification.html>

!


WatchService Events:
---

* `ENTRY_CREATE`
* `ENTRY_DELETE`
* `ENTRY_MODIFY`
* `OVERFLOW` - events may have been lost or discarded.  Does not require registration.

This is untested by me.  It is adapted from the Oracle Java Tutorial page.

!

Lots of more fun!
---


* Asynchronous I/O - call backs - needed for scalability
* Socket-channel functionality - sockets refactored
* Create own FileSystemProvider  (like ZipFileSystem)
* `java.io.Console` - Character-based console device.  `readPassword()`


You'll know when you need it!

new Date+Time API (JSR-310)
---

![](/67e00a0c98132e0be9f1574c8d86bf88.jpg "catlendar")


`http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/jf14-date-time-2125367.html`

!

The JODA library has for a long time been recommended instead of
the default `Calendar` and `Date` classes, especially for differences.  

JSR-310 set out to produce a new set of date and
time handling classes for the standard Java library, where the obvious
choice was to adapt JODA, but the architect
disagreed with some of the design decisions, and took the opportunity to 
fix them.  JSR-310 was included in Java 8 under `java.time.*`.  

The JODA web site recommends
using the new routines instead of JODA for Java 8 onwards.  There is not 
an immediate upgrade path from JODA to `java.time.*` so some
manual work is needed to do so.


!


Highlights:

* Values are always immutable (also known as thread safe).
* Easy to express _durations_ useful relative to a given time.
* Machine time - `Instant` - is separated from human perception of time (like days in a calendar, clock on a wall).
* Human time - `LocalDateTime` - as seen on calendars and watches has no notion of machine time.
* The concept of time _passing_ is abstracted out - `Clock` - making it much easier to write tests involving time.
* Chronologies are abstracted out, allowing non-standard calendars.  Useful in Japan and Thailand.


!

java.util.Date.toInstant()
---

_"To help bridge the gap between the old and new APIâs, the venerable Date class
now has a new method called toInstant() which converts the Date into the new 
representation. This can be especially effective in those cases where you're 
working on an API that expects the classic form, but would like to enjoy everything 
the new API has to offer."_

    System.out.println(new java.util.Date().toInstant());
    // 2016-01-12T09:37:14.910Z

Note:  Z==Zulu/UTC time!

!

Bridging methods:
---


* `Calendar.toInstant()` converts the Calendar object to an Instant.
* `GregorianCalendar.toZonedDateTime()` converts a GregorianCalendar instance to a ZonedDateTime.
* `GregorianCalendar.from(ZonedDateTime)` creates a GregorianCalendar object using the default locale from a ZonedDateTime instance.
* `Date.from(Instant)` creates a Date object from an Instant.
* `Date.toInstant()` converts a Date object to an Instant.
* `TimeZone.toZoneId()` converts a TimeZone object to a ZoneId.

!



LocalDate + LocalTime + LocalDateTime
---

Note: `Month` and `DayOfWeek` enums can make code more readable. `Year` class has `isLeap()` method to help
identify leap years.

* LocalDate represents a date as seen from the context of the observer, like a calendar on the wall.
* LocalTime represents a specific time in a day as seen from the context of the observer, like a clock on the wall.
* LocalDateTime combines both.

Note that there is no trailing timezone indicator.

    LocalDateTime.now() // 2016-01-12T10:37:14.908
    LocalDate.of(2012, Month.DECEMBER, 12) // 2012-12-12
    LocalDate.ofEpochDay(150) // 1970-05-31
    LocalTime.of(17, 18) // 17:18
    LocalTime.parse("10:15:30") // 10:15:30

!

Method naming conventions 1/2:
---

* `of` - creates an instance  where the factory is primarily validating the input parameters, not converting them.
* `from ` - converts the input parameters to an instance of the target class, which may involve losing information from the input.
* `parse` - parses the input string to produce an instance of the target class.
* `format` - uses the specified formatter to format the values in the temporal object to produce a string.
* `get` - returns a part of the state of the target object.
* `is` - queries the state of the target object.

!

Method naming conventions 2/2:
---
* `with` - returns a copy of the target object with one element changed; this is the immutable equivalent to a set method on a JavaBean.
* `plus` - returns a copy of the target object with an amount of time added.
* `minus` - returns a copy of the target object with an amount of time subtracted.
* `to` - converts this object to another type.
* `at` - combines this object with another.

!

Adjustments can be made:

    LocalDate.now().withDayOfMonth(10).withYear(2010)
    // 2010-01-10
    LocalDate.now().plusWeeks(3).plus(3, ChronoUnit.WEEKS)
    // 2016-02-23

"Temporal adjusters" know of calendars.

    LocalDate.now()
    .with(java.time.temporal.TemporalAdjusters.lastDayOfYear())
    // 2016-12-31

!

Different precisions may be interesting, like rounding to the number of seconds or days
a given time corresponds to:

    LocalDateTime.now().truncatedTo(ChronoUnit.DAYS)
    // 2016-01-12T00:00

An exception is thrown if the truncation unit is incompatible with the value.

!

Additionally the `MonthDay` class is useful for birthdays.  The
`YearMonth` class is well suited for credit card expiration dates.

All these classes are supported in JDBC by the getObject/setObject
methods, but do not have dedicated helper methods.

!

Timezones
---

Instructional video:

![timezones](/west-bank-multiple-timezones.png "numberphile")

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5wpm-gesOY>

!

`ZoneOffset` is the period offset from UTC.

    ZoneOffset offset = ZoneOffset.of("+2:00");

`ZoneId` is an identifier for a time zone region.  Use "PLT" or longer like "Europe/Copenhagen".

`ZonedDateTime` is "a date and time with a fully qualified time zone.  This
 can resolve an offset at any point in time.  The rule of thumb is that if you want
 to represent a date and time without relying of the context of a specific server, you should
 use ZonedDateTime.

!

    ZoneId id = ZoneId.of("Europe/Copenhagen");
    ZonedDateTime zdt = ZonedDateTime.of(LocalDateTime.now(), id);
    System.out.println(zdt);
    // 2016-01-12T12:45:16.923+01:00[Europe/Copenhagen]

Strings can be parsed:

    ZonedDateTime.parse("2007-12-03T10:15:30+01:00[Europe/Paris]")
    .truncatedTo(ChronoUnit.HOURS)
    // 2007-12-03T10:00+01:00[Europe/Paris]

Dates and times can be formatted:

    LocalDateTime.now().format(
        DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("YYYY-MM-dd HH:mm"))
    // 2016-01-12 16:09

!


When needing to serialize the zoned date times, convert them to an `OffsetDateTime`, where the
timezone is resolved to an offset.

    ZoneId id = ZoneId.of("Europe/Copenhagen");
    ZonedDateTime zdt =
        ZonedDateTime.of(LocalDateTime.now(), id);
	
    OffsetDateTime odt = OffsetDateTime.from(zdt);
    System.out.println(odt); // 2016-01-12T12:52:49.665+01:00


There are many helper methods to massage these values further.

!

Periods 
---

"Periods represents a date-based value such as '3 months and a day', which is a distance on the timeline" in terms
of wall time.
Can be used for calculations, and to find the "difference" between two date/times.
Periods are aware of daylight savings time.

    Period period = Period.of(1,2,3);
    System.out.println(period);
    // P1Y2M3D  // 1 year, 2 months, 3 days
    System.out.println(LocalDateTime.now().plus(period));
    // 2017-03-15T13:04:08.969
    System.out.println(Period.between(LocalDate.now(),
        LocalDate.now().plusMonths(1))); // P1M

!

Durations
---

Durations are
like Periods, but time-based instead, and do not take daylight savings time in consideration.  For a Duration
a day is _always_ 24 hours.

    Duration duration = Duration.ofSeconds(3, 5);
    System.out.println(duration); // PT3.000000005S
    System.out.println(Duration.between(
        LocalTime.now(), LocalTime.now().plusMinutes(1)));
    // PT1M

!

Note that for differences the ChronoUnit enums have a `between(...)` method

    Instant then = Instant.now();
    Thread.sleep(0,50); // 50 nanoseconds
    System.out.println(
        ChronoUnit.NANOS.between(then, Instant.now()));
    // 1000000

(The tick resolution on Linux for Thread.sleep is 1 ms, so this is the minimum time
the scheduler will let the sleep last).

!

Clock
---

"Most temporal-based objects provide a no-argument `now()` method that
use the system clock and the default time zone, _and_ a one-argument
now(Clock) method that allows you to pass in an alternative Clock."

If for _any_ reason you cannot use the clock as-is from the underlying
operating system, using a `java.time.Clock` allows you to control it
fully.  Note there are two kinds, ticking and standing still:

* `Clock.offset(Clock, Duration)` returns a ticking clock that is offset by the specified Duration.
* `Clock.systemUTC()` returns a clock representing the Greenwich/UTC time zone.
* `Clock.fixed(Instant, ZoneId)` always return the same Instant.  For this clock, *time stands still*. Useful in tests.

<https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/datetime/iso/clock.html>

!

Chronology + ChronoLocalDate + ChronoLocalDateTime + ChronoZonedDateTime
---

These classes support the needs of developers using non-ISO
calendaring systems.

_These classes are there purely for developers who are working on
highly internationalized applications that need to take into account
local calendaring systems, and they shouldnât be used by developers
without these requirements. Some calendaring systems donât even have a
concept of a month or a week and calculations would need to be
performed via the very generic field API._

!

Date and Time Formatting
---

_Although the java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter provides a powerful
mechanism for formatting date and time values, you can also use the
java.time temporal-based classes directly with java.util.Formatter and
String.format, using the same pattern-based formatting that you use
with the java.util date and time classes._

Left as an exercise for the interested reader O:-)

!

Concurrency
---

<http://www.infoq.com/articles/Java-8-Quiet-Features>
<http://winterbe.com/posts/2015/05/22/java8-concurrency-tutorial-atomic-concurrent-map-examples/>

`StampedLock`: Fast optimistic lock, but if failing (which should be
rarely) you will have to redo your work.

`LongAdder`: Faster than AtomicLong (different way to handle contention).  

Parallel Sorting: `Arrays.parallelSort(myArray)` distributes over
cores.  Underlying implementation cannot be tuned, and performance
degrades under high load.

!

Repeatable `@Annotations`
---

       @Retention( RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME )
        public @interface Cars {
            Manufacturer[] value() default{};
        }
        @Manufacturer("Mercedes Benz")
        @Manufacturer("Toyota")
        @Manufacturer("BMW")
        @Manufacturer("Range Rover")
        public interface Car { }
 
        @Repeatable(value = Cars.class )
        public @interface Manufacturer {
            String value();
        };

Note:  Several `@Manufacturer` annotations on `Car`
(silently put in a list).

!
Static checking using annotations:
---

The JVM itself does not yet enforce any kind behavior based on
annotations on source code.

`javac` and IDE's do!

Note that annotations mentioned in the following may be in different
packages and not immediately interchangeable.

!

IntelliJ 1/2:
---
Respects the following directly as part of the source analysis:

* `@NotNull` - null value is forbidden to return (for methods) and
  hold (for local variables and fields).
* `@Nullable` - null value is perfectly valid to return (for methods),
  pass to (for parameters) and hold (for local variables and methods)
* `@NonNls` - string is not to be internationalized.
* `@Contract` - hint the compiler about input and return values.
* `@ParametersAreNonnullByDefault` - annotate a method once, instead
  of all parameters with `@NotNull`.

Also respects JSR-305 and FindBugs annotations directly if part of the
project. Annotations may be put outside Java source in an annotations.xml file
(needs to be configured in the SDK).


!

IntelliJ 2/2
---

Null analysis can be done with "Analyze | Infer Nullity" and
appropriate annotations added.

Checker framework checks at compile time: 

* `@NotNull` - flag if null is being assigned.
* `@ReadOnly` - flag any attempt to change the object.
* `@Regex` - is this string assigned a valid regular expression _string_?
* `@Tainted` + `@Untainted` - avoid mixing data that does not go
together like user input being used in system commands, or sensitive
data in log statements.
* `@m` - ensure units are dealt with properly.

It may also be able to detect SQL injection.

<http://types.cs.washington.edu/checker-framework/>

!

String
===

* String.substring() does not hold on to underlying char array.
* G1 Garbage Collection deduplicates strings.
* String.join(..) allows for easy concatenation of strings.

![stringly typed cat](/d1619b87f6883eaeddd581f5d1184b79.jpg "stringly typed cat")

!

String.substring(...)
---
Note:  Important implementation change!

* `String.substring` used the same underlying char array from the
original string, so it could not be garbage collected when the original string
went out of scope.
* Fixed in Java 1.7.0_06.

<http://stackoverflow.com/a/20275133/53897>

Note:  substring is now O(n) instead of O(1). Discussion on impact
at <https://www.reddit.com/comments/1qw73v>

!

String.join(...)
---
New helper method.  First argument is separator, remaining arguments are joined with
the separator.

    System.out.println(
        String.join(" ", "Hello", "World")
    );

prints `Hello World`.

Use `Collectors.joining()` or `StringJoiner` for more advanced cases.

!

Random numbers
---

"Java 8 has added a new method called `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()` 
whose aim is to have the JVM choose a secure provider for you. "

!

Exact Math
---

"In cases where the size is int or long and overflow errors need to be detected, 
the methods `addExact`, `subtractExact`, `multiplyExact`, and `toIntExact` throw an 
`ArithmeticException` when the results overflow. "

    Math.multiplyExact(1_000_000, 1_000_000);
    // Exception in thread "main"
    //    java.lang.ArithmeticException: integer overflow


<http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html>

!

Process
---

Three new methods in the Process class -

* `destroyForcibly()` - terminates a process with a much higher degree of success than before.
* `isAlive()` tells if a process launched by your code is still alive.
* A new overload for `waitFor()` lets you specify the amount of time
  you want to wait for the process to finish. This returns whether the
  process exited successfully or timed-out in which case you might
  terminate it.

Interfaces:
---

* static methods
* default methods

Interfaces can now hold code.  This helps adding functionality to
existing API's without breaking backward compatibility.

Overview:
<http://www.studytrails.com/java/java8/java8_collections_new_methods.jsp>

!

Interfaces - static methods:
---

Works like for classes.  They are available directly without having
to instantiate a class (which is beneficial for Î»-expressions).

    System.out.println(Function.identity().apply(42));
    // 42

_Many_ new static methods on Comparator, making it much easier to create
a new comparator without having to code the full `compare(..)` method.

!

Of course this can be abused...

    public interface Test {
        static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println("I'm ok!");
        }
    }

<http://stackoverflow.com/q/34710274/53897>

!

Interfaces - default methods:
---

Pre-Java 8 it was impossible to add new methods to interfaces without breaking
existing code as these new methods needed to be implemented too.

A `default` method has an implementation directly in the interface, and
does not _have_ to be implemented (but may) when instantiated.

        List<String> l = Arrays.asList("abc", "Bc", "a");
        l.sort(Comparator.naturalOrder());
        System.out.println(l); // [Bc, a, abc]

Spot the two methods that wasn't possible in Java 7.

!

The implementation in `java.util.List` looks like:

    default void sort(Comparator<? super E> c) {
        ....
    }


1. This allows restricted multiple inheritance (see Scala Traits)
2. Implementing multiple interfaces defining the exact same default 
method is a compilation error.
3. You cannot define variables in an interface so you cannot keep state in
default methods except by passing in a state keeping object.


!

Comparators
---

Boring - all blogs/torturials use this as _the_ example.

Tons of new helper methods!  See how easy it is to sort strings by _length_:

    Comparator c = Comparator.comparing(
                       new Function<String, Integer>() {
                           @Override
                           public Integer apply(String s1) {
                               return s1.length();
                   }})); // <- Ooh, LISP!


See <http://stackoverflow.com/a/24442897/53897> and
<http://blog.jooq.org/2014/01/31/java-8-friday-goodies-lambdas-and-sorting/>

!

Optional - defusing `null` values
---

Tired of checking for `null` in return values?

A `java.util.Optional<T>` either holds exactly one T instance, or is empty.

    System.out.println(Optional.of("!").isPresent());
    // true
    System.out.println(Optional.empty().isPresent());
    // false
    System.out.println(Optional.ofNullable(null).isPresent());
    // false

Best practice now for methods which return `T` which may be `null`
is to return `Optional<T>`.  For legacy methods, wrap in `ofNullable`.

!

Methods:

* `empty()` - return empty Optional instance.
* `filter(Predicate)` - if value is present and matches predicate return Optional describing value else an empty Optional.
* `flatMap(Function)` - if value is present, apply function to value, else return empty Optional.
* `get()` - gets the element or throw `NoSuchElementException`
* `ifPresent(Consumer)` - if value is present, invoke consumer with value, otherwise do nothing.
* `isPresent()` - returns true if value present, false otherwise.
* `of(T)` - throw exception if value==null, or return Optional value.
* `ofNullable(T)` - returns optional with value if non-null, otherwise an empty Optional.
* `orElse(T)` - return value held if present, otherwise return argument.
* `orElseThrow(Supplier<X>)` - return value if present, otherwise throw the exception created by the provided supplier.

It all comes together...
---

* Î»-expressions
* Streams
* java.util.function.*

_Because sometimes, you need a rainbow butterfly unicorn kitten._




!
Î»-expressions:
===

Î»-expressions allows for implementing interfaces much more concisely than
 anonymous classes.

_Î»-calculus is a formal system in mathematical logic by Alonzo Church for expressing computation based on function abstraction and application using variable binding and substitution.
Lambda calculus is a universal model of computation equivalent to a Turing machine.
Î» is used in lambda terms (also called lambda expressions) to **denote binding a
variable in a function**._

tl;dr - nicer syntax on anonymous classes.

!

Three parts:
---

    (String s) -> "Hello " + s


* Zero or more comma-separated variable definitions in parenthesis.
* `->`
* Statement or block to invoke.  Return type deduced by compiler.

Î»-expressions are _declarations_, not _invocations_.   Actually invoking the
code must be done "outside" the  Î»-expression itself.


!

A single statement:
---

    () -> 42
    () -> null

    (int x) -> x + 1
    (String s) -> "Hello " + s

    (int x, String s) -> x + " " + s

    (int a, int b, int c) -> a + b + c

Again: Zero or more comma separated variable definitions in parenthesis, `->`, and
an expression to be evaluated.

Compiler deduces return type from
invocation context (may be enforced by type casting the Î»-expression)

!

Block:
---

    () -> { System.out.println(
                System.currentTimeMillis()
            ) }


    (String s) -> { log.debug("{}", s);
                    return s;
                  }

Block is surrounded by `{` and `}`  and contains zero or more statements.
`return` statements determines return type. If there is no `return` statement,
it corresponds to a `void` method.

!

Inferred parameter types:
---

The parameter type(s) may be explicitly mentioned:

    (String s) -> "Hello " + s

The compiler may be able to deduce the parameter type(s) from
the context, and then it may be omitted:

    (s) -> "Hello " + s

If there is only one parameter and its type is inferred, the parenthesis is optional:

    s -> "Hello " + s





!

Examples:
---

    (x) -> x + 1
    (s) -> "Hello " + s
    (a, b, c) -> a + b + c


    x -> x + 1
    s -> "Hello " + s
    s -> { log.debug("{}", s); return s; }

The compiler makes an effort to infer the parameter types and the result type from
the surrounding context.  It may give up, and the parameters then have to
be explicitly typed or a typecast applied to the whole Î»-expression.

!

Typecasting a Î»-expression:
---

    Comparator.comparing((Function<String, Integer>) (s1) -> {
       return s1.length();
    }));

Here `(Function<String, Integer>)` is the typecast.
This also allows the compiler to infer the type of `s1`.

IntelliJ uses this for refactorings to preserve exact meaning.

!

Scope:
---
Î»-expressions use lexical scope in the same way as a normal `{}`-delimited block, so
they are allowed to
refer to variables outside the Î»-expression itself if they are "final or effectively final".

"Effectively final variables" mean variables where
"_declaring it final would not cause a compilation failure._"

Variables may be overridden if needed.

`this` is unchanged inside the lambda, and does _not_ refer to the
lambda itself but the surrounding object!

###### <http://cr.openjdk.java.net/~briangoetz/lambda/lambda-state-final.html>

!
Functional Interface underneath:
---

Regardless where a Î»-expression is used, it `<blink>`_must_`</blink>`
implement an interface
with only one abstract method!  This is officially called a *Functional Interface*.

A Î»-expression may only throw the checked exceptions declared in the interface implemented.

The JRE has functional interfaces with up to two parameters (including native types).
None of these allow throwing checked exceptions.  This is important with Streams.

Word of God: Write exception wrappers.


!
Method references
---

Some simple Î»-expressions may be abbreviated even further with the new method
reference syntax.

    context::method

These two are identical:

    Optional.of("!").ifPresent(System.out::println);
    Optional.of("!").ifPresent(e -> System.out.println(e));

!

Reference to a constructor:
---

    e -> new Double(e)

can be abbreviated as

    Double::new

Type information may be provided:

    HashSet<String>::new

!

Reference to a an instance method of a type
---

`(String e) -> e.length()` can be abbreviated with the instance method reference
`String::length`.

    List<String> l = Arrays.asList("abc", "Bc", "a");
    l.sort(Comparator.comparing(String::length));
    System.out.println(l); // [a, Bc, abc]


`Class::instanceMethod` can be used to refer to the instanceMethod on an instance of Class.

!

Reference to a static method:
---

Use `myObject::myStaticMethod`.

No good example :-/

!

Reference to an instance method on a specific variable:
---
Example:

    Optional.of("!").ifPresent(System.out::println);

.

Again, `System.out::println` is shorthand for `e -> System.out.println(e)`.



!

!
@FunctionalInterface
---

Interfaces _intended_ to be functional interfaces -
allowing Î»-expressions to implement them - can explicitly be annotated with
`@FunctionalInterface`.  If so, compilers are required to
check:

* Is an interface (and not something else)
* Has exactly _one_ abstract method.

However, the compiler will treat _**any interface meeting the definition of a
functional interface as a functional interface**_ regardless of whether or not a
`@FunctionalInterface` annotation is present on the interface declaration.

Streams: Iterators on steroids
===

Streams - an new Java 8 API, for handling multiple items
one item at a time, resulting in an answer.

* Map-reduce with LOTS of syntactic sugar.
* Lazy evaluation.
* Parallel/sequential processing in the current JVM.
* Looks like functional programming and SQL.
* But isn't.
* But it looks like!

It is enough to get actual work done!  The API is so rich that
I only look at a subset of features.

!

Map-Reduce:
---

Handle a large input set consisting of similar objects, by:

1. Decide if running sequentially or in parallel.
1. Specify what to do with each input element. ("map" input element to output element)
1. Specify how to have each output element contribute to the final result. ("reduce")

An example could be: "given a list, square each element and return their sum".

The framework then distributes out the input elements, let the mappers work,
collects the results and reduce them to the final result.

###### There is more to it than that but we work in-memory in a single JVM

!

Stream recipe:
---
Do this for every stream you need.  Streams cannot be reused.

1. Start with a `Collection<T>`.
2. Get `Stream<T>` with either `.stream()` or `.parallelStream()`
3. Apply zero or more transformations like `.map(...)`
4. Reduce the stream to the final result with e.g. `.collect(Collectors.toList())`.

```
Arrays.asList(1,2,3,4).stream() // Stream<Integer>
      .map(e -> e + 1)
      .collect(Collectors.toList()) // [2, 3, 4, 5]
```

There are many helper methods to make 1+2 easier.

###### Beware of autoboxing which happens here!!
!

"_given a list, square each element and return their sum_"
---

```
Arrays.asList(1,2,3,4).stream()     // Stream<Integer>
      .mapToInt(Integer::intValue)  // IntStream
      .map(e -> e * e)
      .sum() // 30
```

###### Autoboxing is avoided by using `mapToInt(...)` to convert from `Stream<Integer>` to `IntStream`!  Additionally `IntStream` has the very handy `sum()` method returning the sum of all the elements in the stream.

!

Native streams:
---

    IntStream.of(1, 2, 3, 4).map(e -> e * e).sum()     // 30
    IntStream.range(1, 5).map(e -> e * e).sum()        // 30
    LongStream.rangeClosed(1, 4).map(e -> e * e).sum() // 30

    IntStream si = Arrays.stream(new int[] {1, 2, 3});
    LongStream sl = Arrays.stream(new long[] {1, 2, 3});
    DoubleStream sd = Arrays.stream(new double[] {1, 2, 3});

###### DoubleStream hasn't range/rangeClose, but all the rest.

!

Stream methods returning a Stream:
---

In other words, these can be chained.

* `concat(Stream1, Stream2)` - the concatenation of two streams
* `distinct()` - remove duplicates.
* `filter(Predicate)` - remove those returning false.
* `flatMap(Function)` - map returning element\_S\_.  More later.
* `limit(maxSize)` - do not return more than maxSize elements.
* `iterate(seed, function)` - element(n+1) = function(element(n))
* `map(function)` - apply/map function
* `of(...)` - stream of the zero or more values provided.
* `peek(...)` - debug stream.  More later.
* `skip(n)` - discard the first n elements of the stream.
* `sorted()` - sort all elements.

###### <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/Stream.html>

!


```
import static java.util.stream.Collectors.toList;

Stream.concat(Stream.of(1,2),Stream.of(3,4))
      .collect(toList()) // [1, 2, 3, 4]

Stream.of(1,1,2).distinct().collect(toList()) // [1, 2]

Stream.of(1,2).filter(e->e!=1).collect(toList())); // [2]

```

!

peek(...) - debug tool
---

```
Stream.of(2, 1, 2)
   .peek(e -> System.out.println("before " + e))
   .filter(e -> e != 1)
   .peek(e -> System.out.println("after " + e))
   .collect(Collectors.toList()));  // [2, 2]

before 2
after 2
before 1
before 2
after 2
```

###### Lazy evaluation cause one element at a time to "flow through" the stream as needed.  Only execute those steps needed to get a result!

!

flatMap() - zero or more return values
---

`map` only allows one result. `flatMap` allows zero or more,
all of which are put into the result stream.

```
Arrays.asList(
  Arrays.asList("e", "d", "a"), Arrays.asList("c", "b")
) // [[e, d, a], [c, b]]
.stream()
.flatMap(
    e -> e.stream().sorted()        // [a, d, e] and [b, c]
).collect(Collectors.toList())      // [a, d, e, b, c]

```




###### Inspired by <http://www.adam-bien.com/roller/abien/entry/java_8_flatmap_example>

!

Stream termination to get result:
---

* `.reduce(...)` - hardcore functional programming approach
* `.collect(collector)` - heaps of syntactic sugar on top of `reduce`
* `findAny/findFirst/max/min` - a single element
* `count()/`
* `forEach(consumer)` - apply consumer to each element
* `allMatch(...)/anyMatch(...)/noneMatch(...)` - find characteristic
* `toArray()` - return array of all elements in stream

Remember, streams cannot be reused.

!

Selecting a single element from a Stream:
---

* `findAny()` - any element, we don't care which
* `findFirst()` - first element
* `max(comparator)` - largest element according to comparator.
* `min(comparator)` - smallest element according to comparator.


Returns `Optional<T>` as the selection may fail.

```
Stream.of(1, 2, 3).findFirst().orElseGet(() -> 0) // 1
Stream.of().findFirst().orElseGet(() -> 0) // 0
```

###### Slightly different methods for IntStream/LongStream/DoubleStream.
!

Collector
---

* Goes inside  `.collect(..)`
* Many helper methods in java.util.stream.Collectors.
* Most of the time you want `Collectors.toList()`.

```
List<String> la = Arrays.asList("ad", "bc", "ba", "ac");

la.stream().collect(Collectors.toList())
// [ad, bc, ba, ac]

la.stream().collect(Collectors.joining("/"))
// ad/bc/ba/ac

la.stream().collect(
    Collectors.toCollection(() -> new TreeSet<String>())
) // [ac, ad, ba, bc]
```
!

Collect into a Map:
---

```
la.stream().collect(
  Collectors.groupingBy(e -> e.substring(0, 1))
) // {a=[ad, ac], b=[bc, ba]}

Map<String, String> m = la.stream().collect(
  Collectors.groupingBy(
      e -> e.substring(0,1), Collectors.joining("+")
  )
); // {a="ad+ac", b="bc+ba"}

Arrays.toString(m.entrySet().toArray())
// [a=ad+ac, b=bc+ba]
```

###### The last line is a nice trick to pretty-print a map.


!

Reading files as streams:
---

```
new BufferedReader(...).lines()

Files.lines(Path.get("..."), Charset.defaultCharSet())
```

Remember, the method in the functional interfaces used by streams do not throw exceptions.  For files
you will typically need to catch IOExceptions and wrap them in a RuntimeException.

!

Parallel streams:
---

Use `.parallelStream()` instead of `.stream()` to enable parallel processing in
current JVM.  Very simple optimization.  Unfortunately
has some overhead.  Do not use uncritically!

Uses global ForkJoinPool:

* Avoid long processing in multithreaded applications.
* Untunable thread pool.

Use unordered streams if possible.
